HARDWARE DESIGN FILES
You can download OpenPLC hardware design files in two formats: Kicad (the entire project) and .PDF (only schematics). The Kicad files are compressed in zip format. Once extracted with you favorite extraction utility, you must have Kicad installed to open, view and modify the files.

FIRMWARE FILES
Below are the firmware files for the input card, output card and cpu card. Both source code and binary HEX files are available in the .zip archive. The code was written in C/C++ and was compiled using the Arduino IDE v1.0.3 with Arduino UNO as target for all cards, except for the cpu card where the target was Arduino Mega 2560 instead.
